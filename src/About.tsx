      <p className="mb-4">
        Hi, I‚Äôm <strong>Kenji</strong> ‚Äî a frontend engineer and hands-on maker
        with a passion for building things, whether in code or in the shop.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Most recently, I‚Äôve been diving deep into{" "}
        <strong>CNC machining and digital fabrication</strong> through the{" "}
        <strong>HumanMade CNC Training Program</strong> (April 2025 ‚Äì present).
        I‚Äôve trained on a range of tools ‚Äî from manual mills and Tormach CNCs to
        band saws, drill presses, and jeweler‚Äôs saws ‚Äî and built several
        functional and creative projects. I also leveled up my skills in{" "}
        <strong>CAD and CAM with Fusion 360</strong>, giving me a strong
        understanding of how software and hardware intersect in real-world
        production.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Before that, I worked as a{" "}
        <strong>Frontend Engineer at Breinify</strong>, where I led the
        development of complex UI features for large-scale data platforms. I
        built tools for API monitoring, messaging systems, reporting dashboards,
        and more ‚Äî working closely with cross-functional teams to ship polished,
        high-impact software. My contributions helped analysts and developers
        work faster and more effectively with massive datasets.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Between roles, I experienced a layoff ‚Äî but I stayed active and
        resourceful. I took on jobs like house painting and babysitting, which
        not only kept me grounded but also reminded me of the value of
        adaptability, patience, and work ethic. That time also gave me space to
        explore new skills and rediscover my love for building with my hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I‚Äôm focused on opportunities that let me combine my frontend
        experience with my growing capabilities in fabrication, engineering, and
        design. I bring a builder‚Äôs mindset, a user-focused approach, and a
        drive to learn and create at every level.
