      <h1>Machining a Precision Aluminum Dice</h1>
      <p>
        In this project, I wanted to challenge myself with something deceptively
        simple: making a precision dice cube out of aluminum using a manual
        mill. While it may seem straightforward, the tolerances and attention to
        detail demanded a level of care that rivals CNC work.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 1: Cutting the Raw Stock</h2>
      <p>
        I started with a rough-cut 1in x 1in x 5in aluminum block and used a
        vertical bandsaw to bring it down to just over the target size of{" "}
        <strong>0.95 inches</strong>. The vertical bandsaw is perfect for
        quickly removing bulk material while getting the stock close to square.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 2: Precision Facing on the Manual Mill</h2>
      <p>
        With the stock roughed out, I moved to the manual mill for the real
        precision work. I faced all six sides of the cube, using a dial
        indicator and edge finder to ensure squareness and repeatability. The
        goal was a final dimension of exactly 0.9500 inches on all sides — and I
        was able to achieve this within <strong>-0.0003 inches</strong> of
        tolerance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This meant a lot of micrometer checks between passes, light climb cuts,
        and care to avoid deflection or tool pressure issues. It’s satisfying to
        hold something that precise and know it was made completely by hand.
      </p>

      <h2>Step 3: Drilling the Dice Dots</h2>
      <p>
        Once the cube was finished to size, I laid out the classic dice pattern.
        Using a center drill bit on the manual mill, I employed the{" "}
        <strong>peck drilling</strong> technique to mark each dot cleanly and
        accurately. Peck drilling helps clear chips and ensures each mark is
        clean and centered, especially in a shallow hole like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I referenced each face from the same corner using a precise vise and
        1-2-3 blocks to maintain consistent offsets and symmetry across each
        face.
